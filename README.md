## Setup

### Dependencies

- Run `npm install` in project directory. This will install server-related dependencies such as `express`
- `cd client` and run `npm install`. This will install client dependencies

### Database Prep

- Access the MySQL interface in your terminal by running `mysql -u root -p`
- Create a new database called focaldb: `create database focaldb;`
- Create a `.env` file in project directory and add

```bash
  DB_NAME=focaldb
  DB_PASS=YOURPASSWORD
  JWT_SECRET=YOURSECRET
```

- Replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your actual password

- Run `npm run migrate` in the main folder of this repository, in a new terminal window. This will create 4 tables (applications, events, organizations and users) in your database.

### Run Your Development Servers

- Run `npm start` in project directory to start the Express server on port 5000
- `cd client` and run `npm start` to run your development build. The app will run on `http://localhost:8080` as the default port.
